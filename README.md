# SnackSense
Snack Sense is a playful yet genuinely useful web app that predicts what snack you're craving. It starts as a simple virtual fortune cookie, but over time it becomes personalised; users rate each prediction and they system learns their preferences to generate more accurate suggestion. Made with HTML, CSS and JS with all data saved locally on device
