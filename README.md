# 🍪 Snack Sense

Snack Sense is a fun little web app where you crack open a virtual fortune cookie to reveal a random snack prediction.  
Every snack belongs to a category (sweet, sour, salty, fruity, spicy, chocolatey, crispy, savory, misc), and your ratings help shape what you see next.

The more you use it, the better it learns your taste.
